# Orchestration

Container orchestration is all about managing the lifecycles of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments. Software teams use container orchestration to control and automate many tasks:

* Provisioning and deployment of containers
* Redundancy and availability of containers
* Scaling up or removing containers to spread application load evenly across host infrastructure
* Movement of containers from one host to another if there is a shortage of resources in a host, or if a host dies
* Allocation of resources between containers
* External exposure of services running in a container with the outside world
* Load balancing of service discovery between containers
* Health monitoring of containers and hosts
* Configuration of an application in relation to the containers running it
